# Mask-Wearing Detection with Computer Vision Techniques
A project leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect mask-wearing from images. This project demonstrates strong skills in image processing, feature extraction (HOG, SIFT), and classification model development (CNN, SVM, and MKP).

## Project Overview
This project was part of the Masterâ€™s in Data Science program at City, University of London (2024), where it was awarded a Distinction.

## Key Components
- Image Preprocessing: Techniques to enhance and standardize images for analysis.
- Feature Extraction: Utilized methods like HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for image feature extraction.
- Model Development: Trained and evaluated machine learning models including:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  - Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)
-  Evaluation and Insights: Assessed models on accuracy, precision, and recall to identify the most effective approach.

## Goals
- Automated Mask Detection: Develop a robust solution to identify mask-wearing from images.
- Demonstrate Proficiency: Showcase skills in computer vision and machine learning techniques.
- Provide Actionable Results: Evaluate the feasibility of mask detection for real-world applications.

## Key Findings
- CNN Performance: Achieved the highest accuracy among models due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.
- Feature-Based Models: SVM and MLP models with extracted features also demonstrated good performance but required extensive preprocessing.
- Insights: High-quality image preprocessing and feature extraction significantly improved model outcomes.

## Data Availability
The datasets used in this project are not publicly available due to privacy and copyright restrictions.

- Image Datasets: Two sets of image data (training and testing) were used for model development. These datasets are excluded from this repository.
- Video Dataset: A video from the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control and Prevention was used for model testing. The video is also not included in this repository but can be accessed via the [Taiwan CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Advocacy/SubIndex/2xHloQ6fXNagOKPnayrjgQ?diseaseId=N6XvFa1YP9CXYdB0kNSA9A).
