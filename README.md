# mask-detection-cv
This project demonstrates the use of computer vision techniques to detect whether individuals are wearing masks in images. The solution leverages various machine learning models (such as CNN, SVM, MLP) and image feature extraction techniques (like HOG and SIFT) to identify mask usage from facial images.
